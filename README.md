# Snitch - Final Project For My Degree -> Software Engineering
# :star2:5️⃣ Snitch Is One Of The Top 5 Projects 5️⃣:star2: 
### Snitch is an Android-based application designed to connect parents with their new drivers. The application provides real-time tracking of the driving, interprets the driving behavior of the driver, and monitors unusual driving events

# :star2: :zap: What Is Snitch? :zap: :star2:
The system is designed to provide real-time information, fully synchronized between the parent and the new driver, from the moment the driver starts their journey in the car until its end. The real-time information provided to the parent will focus on several key and important aspects:

- Driving speed.
- Vehicle location.
- Aggressive accelerations.
- Aggressive braking.
- Emergency braking.
  
Additionally, the system will provide the parent with the driver's profile, where they can view recent trips with a summary of the data for each trip. The data summary of a trip includes classifying the driver's driving style as aggressive, normal, or slow.
The engineering methods and technologies I used to create the system are:
